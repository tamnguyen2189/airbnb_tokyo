## What is Airbnb?
Airbnb is an online market place that allows travellers to enter their desired travel destination, 
dates and number of guests into a search bar which then connects these travellers with people who want to rent out there homes.

-	A wide selection of property types, in depth descriptions of listings and booking flexibility to name a few.

## Tokyo Airbnb
We will be taking a look at the Airbnb market in Tokyo, Japan.

## Room Types
We decided to narrow our focus further by narrowing  the room types on offer through Airbnb into four main sub categories.

## Travel Group Types
The big question we wanted to answer with our presentation is where the optimal location would be to stay if we were travelling to Tokyo on a budget utilizing Airbnb.

We took a look at this question from the vantage point of three groups of travellers. 
1) The Solo Traveller. 
2) A Group of 2
3) A group of 3 friends. 

### 1. Solo Traveller
The first question we had was what was the optimal room type by price would be for the solo traveller. As you can see we settled on 3 types of rooms. 

Price

The Shared room – with excellent price would be ideal for a solo traveller looking to be social and make friends while the Hotel room and Private room might be best for a solo traveller looking for a bit of privacy.

Location

The map gives a great visual representation of the areas that have the best average price for the room types that we recommend for our Solo Traveller (In this case the shared room). 
The four areas are Adachi Ku, Katshushika Ku, Sumida Ku and Arakawa Ku

Top rated

Finally, we filtered our findings by the top rated options in that location. 
As you can see from the picture we settled on these two options as they had excellent reviews and ratings as well as several favourable comments.

### 2. Pair
Next we took a look at the problem from the viewpoint of a pair of travellers.

Price

When we took a look at the numbers we saw that the difference in price between the four types of room for a pair of travellers was very small. 
We went back and forth for a while and decided that a pair of travellers could have vastly different preferences. 

For one, they could be on a romantic getaway and as such want a little privacy (thus the entire house or hotel room options) or they could want to make friends with other couples, 
get to know the host or save every cent possible (thus the shared room option).  

For these reasons we decided to take a look at all of the room types when moving onto the next step of our analysis

Location

Once again our map shows the 4 cheapest areas taking into account all of the room types. 
In this case these neighbourhoods were Kita Ku, Koto Ku, Bunkyo Ku, Sumida Ku and Chuo Ku.

Top rated

Following our analysis, we decided that the best two options available were in fact two Entire home listings. 
One is in Sumida Ku and is said to be perfect for couples while the other is in Chuo Ku and according to the comments has an exceptional host!

### 3. Group of Three

Last but not least we had a look at the trip from the standpoint of a group of three. 

Price

Once again there was very little to choose between the four options but we settled on the entire home option as it was the cheapest option and we felt it provided a group of three more flexible accommodation options and space!

![group1](/images/group1.jpg)

Location

In this case the four cheapest neighbourhoods for Entire homes were Adachi Ku, Bunkyo Ku, Koto Ku and Sumida Ku.

![group2](/images/group2.jpg)

Top rated

The two options that we settled on both had exceptional reviews and ratings. 
The entire home in Sumida Ku was the cheaper of the two options and was said to be spacious, quiet and convenient. 
Our second option was a little more luxurious and pricey but is very clean and spacious according to the guest comments.
